# Virtualising & Distributing Data through Acacia (Pawsey) & Nirin (NCI)

At AMOS 2026 (Hobart, February), we did a bunch of alpha user testing on a new tool we've been working on, [the ACCESS-NRI Interactive Data Catalogue](https://access-nri.github.io/interactive-data-catalogue/#/).
This is a tool that lets people click through the catalogue of data that we maintain on Gadi.

The key insight that powers this is that the metadata that we trawl, index, and make available in order to discover what climate data products are available on Gadi is on the order of megabytes, not petabytes, which means that we can ship it straight to the browser. As a result, we can stream data indices for around 20PB of data and let users click through them, in pretty much real time.

This all sounds great, but it has a few limitations:

- We use intake-esm to index our datasets. These datasets are on disk on Gadi, NCI's HPC System. Indexing produces parquet files containing metadata about the datasets in question, but those datasets are still unreachable. As a result, we are unable to display any richer information.

  The pangeo catalog gets around this limitation by using a properly cloud native approach. The datasets, not just the indices are made available through object storage, and this means that they can dump a _full xarray repr_ straight into the page (eg. https://catalog.pangeo.io/browse/master/atmosphere/era5_hourly_reanalysis_single_levels_sa/). With our current approach, this is fundamentally impossible.

  This is, unfortunately, a major limitation of our Hybrid HPC/Cloud system, because people are used to looking at the results of `xr.open_mfdataset`, and less used to looking at a bunch of data indices wrapped around it.

  Unfortunately, if you can't get your hands on the `repr`, which is just an interactive view of the dataset metadata, our hopes of getting anything more interesting are also zero.

- We have to keep two catalogues manually synced: one on disk (Gadi), and one in object storage (currently, [ARDC's Nectar](https://ardc.edu.au/services/ardc-nectar-research-cloud/)). NCI compute nodes don't have any internet access, and ARE sessions seem to be throttled pretty heavily for reasons I still don't fully understand.

  Whilst you can create an intake-esm datastore with local paths and dump it into object storage (the paths will then only work if you download that datastore to the machine it was built on, but you can explore them anywhere), the download performance on ARE makes this a generally fairly poor experience for the user - better to keep it on disk locally.

  If they want to access a catalog in object storage from a compute node, they're totally out of luck. (Well, maybe not totally... NCI have their own cloud, Nirin, which compute nodes might be able to talk to? More on that later!)

- Users still need to get themselves on NCI in order to access the data. This might be straightforward, if they're in a university research group with other NCI users, or they know someone with a compute allocation who is happy to add them to their project.

  **In theory, anyone with an Australian academic or government email address should be able to get themselves onto NCI to look at this data (as far as I'm aware). In practice, this is going to limit data access to people who already know how to access it. If we want this data to be used to it's full potential, we need to do better.**

---

When we were gathering feedback on the interactive catalogue tool, a few people mentioned that it would be really handy to actually look at the data itself when exploring the data. This is a much bigger task - it's a lot easier to ship a few megabytes than several petabytes. Actually shipping the data, rather than just a metadata index, means figuring out a way to let users actually download the slice of the data they're interested in looking at. This means you have a couple of hard requirements:

1. You cannot build a system that forces a user to download an entire netCDF file in order to look at a subset of it. If that netCDF file is 25GB, there's just no way of doing it in real time, even in the totally unrealistic case that you somehow managed to saturate the 10Gb/s bandwidth that is in theory available through your computers ethernet port.
2. You need to be able to anonymously & instantaneously access data. I have no real evidence of this, but think of all the times that you've (and I'm talking from experience here):
   - Tried to access some data, only to be told to register for an account. Can you really be bothered to?
   - Shut a page because it was loading slowly (I think Agoda found anything over 300ms loses something like half the visitors before it finishes opening).
   - Decided a Youtube video wasn't worth waiting for the ads to finish.

   People just don't care that much, and especially if they don't know whether they're going to find the resources they're looking for. Things need to be fast, and slick.

3. The data needs to be on an HPC system, somehow. This is Australia, and we don't do cloud. Maybe in 10 years...

Squaring all these requirements would get a bit tough, if not for some of the amazing infrastructure work done by Tom Nicholas (virtualizarr) and Martin Durant (kerchunk) in particular, as well as the rest of the guys at Earthmover and carbonplan. Without all their hard work, this never would have gotten off the ground.

The second slice of luck is that I'd recently got an allocation for the Pawsey supercomputing centre, 20 minutes down the road from my house in Perth, WA.
When building their HPC system, Pawsey just so happened to implement an S3 compatible Ceph object store, _Acacia_, instead of a more traditional `gdata` area. Very lucky!

When I first had a crack at this, I wasn't super sure about how easy it was going to be to get what I was after out of Acacia. I've mostly heard people describe it as weird, and/or hard to use. Apparently, it can be a little contrived to spin up a Jupyter sever on Setonix (the HPC proper) and have it read files in Acacia. Fortunately, that's not my use case - I was specifically interested about whether we could use this to ship data to _users who weren't on Setonix_.

## Virtualisation

### Zarr

If you want to send these large array datasets over the wire (eg., stream it to a browser viewer widget), the only way to do it is Zarr (okay, there probably are other ways. I'm ignoring them anyway). There have been various other solutions in the past - things like Thredds - but fundamentally, the user experience of those things is less than pleasant.

Zarr is basically a rethink of netCDF/HDF, designed to be optimised for cloud storage and access. The problem is it really does not play nicely with HPC systems, especially those with a lustre filesystem (like NCI's Gadi machine).
If you take a typical ocean model run, with maybe 200 years of data spread across maybe 800 netCDF files, and reserialise it as zarr, you typically wind up creating hundred of thousands, maybe millions of inodes. Ignoring recent developments, this is basically because each chunk in the zarr store (the equivalent of all our netCDF files) gets its own inode.

On a lustre filesystem, this is a big no-no, and as a result, Zarr hasn't really taken off in Australia (remember, we don't do cloud). At that same AMOS, someone referred to zarr as an 'emerging format' - despite its already (extremely) widespread adoption, and being on version 3. I guess Python is an emerging programming language in some places too?

### Virtualisating netCDF datasets

Virtualisation is basically the way to square the circle here.
Virtualizarr lets you take a bunch of netCDF's and create a 'Virtual Zarr store' from them: something that you can query and work with as if were zarr, with the backend infrastructure handling fetching all the file chunks for you.
The idea here was that it means you can pop a bunch of netCDF files in the cloud - which is typically a fairly bad idea - see [this blog post](https://earthmover.io/blog/fundamentals-what-is-cloud-optimized-scientific-data) by Tom Nicholas - and then virtualise them, making it as fast to access them as if they were Zarr.

To my knowledge, Martin Durant (who originally conceived of kerchunk to do this), was mostly interested in the problem of getting these netCDF type files out of cloud object storage efficient. However, virtualisation (perhaps inadvertantly - I don't know the history) also solves a bunch of other problems.

- Opening large, multifile datasets. On a lustre file system, opening a file that hasn't been touched in a while can be really slow - like, upwards of a couple of seconds slow. This means that if you want to open a dataset with eg. 500 files, a really nontrivial amount of time (from the users perspective) can be spent _just opening files_. A kerchunk reference can be as simple as a single json file - so the you spend less time fighting the filesystem to get a `repr`. (You still pay this cost _if you actually need data from each of those files_, but 1. you might only need a tiny subset of the files, and 2. people expect doing big complicated calculations on gargantuan datasets to take a while anyway).
- Combining large, multifile datasets. When we open all these files as one dataset, there is still work to be done stitching all the files together into a single object - even if we don't bother to perform any validity checks. Virtualisation lets us do this _once_, and then cache the result.

All in all - even on a posix filesystem, a virtualised dataset is a way better solution than a bunch of netCDF files, and unless we change from lustre, it's also workable from an inode perspective, unlike reserialising everything as zarr. (Again, I'm totally ignoring sharding and zipped zarr stores here.)

## Getting this all working on Pawsey

Getting started on Acacia was really straightfoward. I've used GCS for some personal stuff before, thanks to their forever free tier, but I'd never played with S3/Ceph, and I'd only been on Setonix once or twice before. Luckily, their documentation has clearly been actually used, because I just followed along (No LLM helping me!) and was able to get set up in under an hour.

I decided to make 3 buckets on Pawsey: an `01deg` and `1deg` bucket under my user storage area, and a `ct-zarr-test` bucket under an ACCESS-NRI trial project storage area we had.

Why under both? I'd heard off someone that Acacia might restrict policies (and cors headers) to only be freely available for buckets in user storage, and I wanted to test that. You only get 100GB of quota in your personal user storage, so if we wanted to virtualise real datasets, it would need to work for project storage too.

One step at a time though...

## Virtualising Climate Data on Acacia

After I got the bucket set up and some data copied in, I spent a few hours poking at the `01deg` bucket and trying to make a virtual, remotely-consumable dataset. A few hours later, I had exactly what I was after. Here's how it went down: see [this notebook](https://github.com/charles-turner-1/PawseyVirtualisationTests/blob/main/pawsey/vz_01deg.ipynb) if you want to see the full process.

## What I did

- Open a single NetCDF from the bucket over S3 to check permissions and basic reads: `xarray` + `h5netcdf` with anonymous client options against `s3://01deg`. A cold read takes about 7 seconds to open the dataset:

  ```python
    import xarray as xr

    url = "s3://01deg/output980/iceh.2146-01.nc"

    ds = xr.open_dataset(
        url,
        engine="h5netcdf",
        backend_kwargs={
            "storage_options": {
                "anon": True,
                "client_kwargs": {"endpoint_url": "https://projects.pawsey.org.au"},
            }
        },
    )
  ```

  If you're following along at home, you should be able to execute this code yourself - it's a publicly readable bucket, and running this code was a (very comfortable) way of proving it to myself.

- Use `virtualizarr` (the `HDFParser` + `S3Store` combo) to build a virtual dataset across many files via `open_virtual_mfdataset`. The code for this is remarkably simple:

  ```python
  import os
  from virtualizarr import open_virtual_mfdataset
  from virtualizarr.parsers import HDFParser
  import obstore
  from obstore.store import S3Store
  from obspec_utils.registry import ObjectStoreRegistry

  import numcodecs.zarr3  # Register the zarr3 codec

  from dotenv import load_dotenv

  load_dotenv()

  access_key_id = os.environ.get("ACCESS_KEY_ID")
  secret_access_key = os.environ.get("SECRET_ACCESS_KEY")
  endpoint = "https://projects.pawsey.org.au"
  bucket = "s3://01deg"


  # # create anon s3 store
  # store = S3Store.from_url(f"{scheme}{path}", endpoint=endpoint, skip_signature=True)

  # create s3 store with aws-style credentials
  store = S3Store.from_url(
      f"{bucket}",
      endpoint=endpoint,
      access_key_id=access_key_id,
      secret_access_key=secret_access_key,
  )

  registry = ObjectStoreRegistry({f"{bucket}": store})

  parser = HDFParser()


  urls = []
  for batch in obstore.list(store):
      for obj in batch:
              urls.append(obj.get("path"))


  combined_vds = open_virtual_mfdataset(
      urls=urls,
      parser=parser,
      registry=registry,
      combine="nested",
      concat_dim="time",
      parallel="dask",
      compat="override",
      coords=["time"],
  )
  ```

  For whatever reason, I had to pass credentials to my store. Maybe if I tried an anonymous store without credentials, things would have worked. I didn't bother investigating, because I created my virtual dataset before worrying about making it publicly readable.

- Persist the combined virtual dataset in a few formats for downstream testing: an `icechunk` repo, a kerchunk JSON reference, and a parquet reference file. For reasons I also didn't bother investigating, I ran into issues writing the kerchunk reference straight into the bucket, but the icechunk one was fine.

  This can be done with eg.

  ```python
  # Now put the virtual dataset in the bucket alongside the netcdf files
  import icechunk
  from pathlib import Path

  # Create a new repository instance with virtual chunk container permissions for reading
  config = icechunk.RepositoryConfig.default()
  config.set_virtual_chunk_container(
      icechunk.VirtualChunkContainer(
          url_prefix=f"{bucket}/",
          store=icechunk.s3_store(
              endpoint_url=endpoint,              # "https://projects.pawsey.org.au"
              s3_compatible=True,
              force_path_style=True,
          )
      ),
  )

  credentials = icechunk.containers_credentials(
      {
          bucket: icechunk.s3_credentials(
              access_key_id=access_key_id,
              secret_access_key=secret_access_key,
          )
      }
  )

  # Open the repository with the config that includes virtual chunk permissions
  storage = icechunk.s3_storage(
      bucket='01deg',
      prefix='icechunk',
      endpoint_url=endpoint,
      access_key_id=access_key_id,
      secret_access_key=secret_access_key,
      force_path_style=True,
  )

  repo = icechunk.Repository.create(
      storage,
      config,
      authorize_virtual_chunk_access=credentials
  )

  # Write your virtual dataset to the repository
  write_session = repo.writable_session("main")
  combined_vds.vz.to_icechunk(write_session.store)
  write_session.commit("Write Pawsey 01deg virtual dataset to acacia zarr store for testing")
  ```

  to write a virtual icechunk store into the bucket, or

  ```python
  combined_vds.vz.to_kerchunk(
      filepath="file:///Users/u1166368/scratch/virtualizarr/pawsey/ref-01deg.json",
  )
  ```

  to write it to a json file on my local machine. I'll come back to that later.

## Bucket permissions & CORS

The data streaming app I built is totally serverless - the browser just fetches the data directly from the bucket, without any proxy, intermediate server, or auth flow. This is ideal for performance and user experience, but it does mean that the bucket needs to be configured to allow anonymous reads from browsers.

This means we need to make two changes to the bucket policy:

1. Allow public read access to objects in the bucket. Note, I don't think we need to allow public read access to the bucket itself, just the objects - this would means that users as well as users being able to fetch the data if they know the exact path, they could list all the contents of the bucket - which is apparently bad. I allowed it anyway, because it was the first thing that worked. However, we definitely don't allow public write access, etc., because that would be a disaster.
2. Set a CORS policy that allows simple `GET`/`HEAD` requests from the origins we want to allow.

Browsers enforce Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) rules when making requests to a different domain (ie. from our data streamer app to the Acacia object store). If CORS is not configured correctly, the browser will just block requests entirely.

There are two types of cross-origin requests:

- **Simple requests** (fast): standard `GET`/`HEAD` requests with no custom headers. These are sent directly.
- **Preflighted requests** (slower): if the request includes non-standard headers (e.g. `Authorization`), the browser first sends an `OPTIONS` request to check permissions before issuing the real request.

To maximise performance (especially when making many small chunk requests), we want to avoid preflight requests entirely. This means:

- Clients should only send simple `GET`/`HEAD` requests
- No custom headers (especially no `Authorization`)
- Data must be publicly readable (anonymous access)

The CORS policy below allows simple requests from any origin. In production, we'd probably want to lock it down via `AllowedOrigins` to specific domains.

- I'm not sure that I set the public read access correctly either - I'm probably a bit too much of a carefree loose unit with this stuff, but there's no sensitive data in there, and this is just a test anyway.

For whatever reason, I couldn't apply these policies whilst I was logged into Setonix - I had to do it from my local machine (presumably any other non-setonix machine would work just fine too.)

1. Public read for objects

Create a `public-read.json` (replace `<BUCKET_NAME>`):

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicList",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::virtual-cmorization"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "PublicRead",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": ["s3:GetObject"],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::virtual-cmorization/*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "AuthenticatedWrite",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": { "AWS": ["arn:aws:iam:::user/cturner"] },
      "Action": ["s3:PutObject", "s3:DeleteObject", "s3:GetObject"],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::virtual-cmorization/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

Apply it using the AWS CLI (remember `--endpoint-url` for Acacia):

```bash
aws s3api put-bucket-policy   --endpoint-url https://projects.pawsey.org.au   --bucket virtual-cmorization   --policy file://list-and-read-vz-cmor.json --profile cturner
```

2. Minimal CORS (avoid preflight)

Browsers send OPTIONS preflight when a request isn't "simple" (e.g. custom headers). To avoid that, make your clients issue plain GET/HEAD without custom headers and set a CORS policy that allows those methods. What I used (but prefer locking down origins):

```json
{
  "CORSRules": [
    {
      "AllowedOrigins": ["*"],
      "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "HEAD"],
      "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
      "ExposeHeaders": [
        "Content-Range",
        "Accept-Ranges",
        "Content-Length",
        "Content-Type",
        "ETag"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Apply with:

```bash
aws s3api put-bucket-cors   --endpoint-url https://projects.pawsey.org.au   --bucket virtual-cmorization --profile cturner --cors-configuration file://cors.json
```

Notes and best practice

- Prefer restricting `AllowedOrigins` to the exact origin(s) rather than `*` for security.
- To really avoid preflight, clients must not send custom headers (no `Authorization`). If you must use credentials, expect preflights and configure the server accordingly.
- For Acacia and other S3-compatible stores: always pass `--endpoint-url` and consider `force_path_style=True` in clients.

Did I do all this 'correctly'? Maybe, probably not. I wrote a 1st draft of this write up using Claude, and it gave me some policies which looked surprisingly(...worryingly?) different to the ones here. But whatever, this is a work in progress. Again, there's no personally identifiable information, sensitive data, etc. in this bucket.

If you are dealing with those sorts of things, please don't use this as a how to guide - I really don't fully know what I'm doing yet. I mean, this whole write up is mostly so I don't have to trawl git histories to piece back together how to do this.

# Okay... why? What's the end goal?

The guys over at carbonplan have been working on [this visualisation tool](https://github.com/carbonplan/zarr-layer), which I came across recently. I figured this was exactly what we needed in order to produce the over the wire data exploration tool which people wanted.

Using zarr-layer, [zarrita](https://zarrita.dev/) (a typescript library for dealing with zarr files), and Claude Sonnet 4.6 to speed up the process, I managed to generate [this interactive data explorer](https://charles-turner-1.github.io/personal-homepage/#/projects/zarr-data-streamer) in about 2 hours.

Remember how I said above that I couldn't figure out how to get the kerchunk reference file to read into/out of the acacia bucket correctly. In the end, I would up just saving it locally, and then shipping it to the browser as a static object with this data viewer.

Zarrita then just reads this local object out of the browsers javascript bundle, and from that knows how and where to fetch chunks from the acacia bucket on demand.

This is something we should probably figure out - its probably cleaner to keep it in the bucket, and then fetch it when we need it, rather than with every load of my homepage, but Rome wasn't built in a day.

This demo is still obviously very rough and ready - it's still on native grids for a start - but it's clearly a massive improvement over current data exploration tools, and surprisingly easy to get working. It turns out you can get a lot done by grabbing onto the coattails of very smart people.

# Trying the same thing on NCI / Nirin

So virtualising and streaming data from Acacia works remarkably well. Great!

Unfortunately, we deal with making climate data available to scientists in Australia, and most of Australia's trove of climate data is hosted on Gadi. This means we have two options (ignoring the sit on our hands approach):

1. Move the data to Acacia and host it from there. This is a bit of a non starter for a lot of reasons - but most of the work the climate science community does on HPC is on Gadi. So we'd either have to duplicate the data, or stream it back to Gadi. Neither of these are really tenable.
2. See if we can do the same thing on NCI's object storage, Nirin.

It turns out the answer to the second question is... maybe?

1. It's a lot more fiddly than Acacia, and there are some pretty big performance issues to work through.
2. I haven't yet figured out whether it's possible to read the chunks the references point to from outside Gadi. Some of the documentation suggests it might be possible via NFS mounts, but I haven't gotten that working yet.

Still, it's a step in the right direction.

## Why Nirin feels harder

I ran the same experiments on Nirin and hit a different (unfortunately bigger) set of operational annoyances compared with Acacia. Short version:

- Protocol & gateway differences: Nirin exposes both Swift and an S3 gateway (e.g. `https://cloud.nci.org.au:8080/swift/...` and `s3://ct-icechunk-root/...`). In these experiments, I accessed the kerchunk reference remotely via the Swift endpoint while icechunk tests used the S3 gateway + credentials. This is because apparently public reads on Nirin buckets can only be achieved via Swift, not S3.
- No anonymous S3 reads: the S3 gateway did not allow anonymous access. That means consumers need credentials, signed URLs, or a trusted proxy inside Nirin to serve data. This means that if we want to read the icechunk store remotely, we need to provide credentials, as icechunk doesn't support swift.
- Performance variability: reads from ARE (interactive environment) over Swift were noticeably slower than remote reads. I think there is some throttling of downloads into an ARE session, for reasons I don't totally understand.

  With that said, it is still substantially faster to read the virtual references than the raw data: 2 minutes 40 for the non virtualised dataset, 45s for the kerchunk reference over swift into an ARE session, and 2.6 seconds for the kerchunk reference remotely.

  Unfortunately, the performance improvement of kerchunk references will probably diminish for smaller datasets. I haven't run any scaling tests, but I assume that the end result will be that kerchunk will be much slower for virtualised datasets that only contain eg. ten files than just opening the files, if we access the reference via swift.

- Weirdly, you don't see the same performance issues with icechunk: it reads in 1.6 seconds from within an ARE session, but takes 2.2 remotely. This makes a bit more sense _a priori_, but it's weird that we see such a massive slowdown via Swift, when it's actually faster via s3.
- Icechunk vs Swift: icechunk doesn't speak Swift, so writing icechunk repos required the S3 gateway and credentials — more friction than the Acacia case.

  This might be less of a big deal than it seems. You can't stream zarr from an icechunk store straight into the browser (true, AFAIK, at time of writing due to Javascript being single threaded and icechunk multi), so if you want to use the same set of virtual references for both remote data streaming/exploration, and to speed up reads on Gadi, you need to use kerchunk (or set up a server to handle getting data from icechunk to the browser).

  However, it does mean that the slowdown of kerchunk over Swift is more of an issue. Either we'd need to figure out how to speed up access to the kerchunk reference over Swift, or make the s3 gateway support anonymous reads and then read the kerchunk reference via that.

- Compute-node access: the other big operational question for putting virtual reference datasets on Gadi is whether compute nodes can talk to Nirin endpoints directly. If they can't, then you'd need to have these references on the posix filesystem somewhere too. This is fine - in theory - but the number of these we'd be creating increases the risk that something gets out of sync. It seems like the atomicity guarantees that Swift provides aren't particularly great either...
- In the other direction, if we want to read the chunks out of the virtual references, we need some way of doing that. As of right now, this is an unresolved question. Maybe we'll get there eventually, but it's definitely not going to be as easy as with Acacia. This obviously makes streaming data out quite a bit harder.

- Documentation: The documentation for Acacia is really pretty clear, and easy to follow. Acacia is built on Ceph, and access is using the AWS CLI. In contrast, Nirin has multiple access methods (Swift, S3 gateway) and the documentation is a quite a bit less complete. It also doesn't seem to be up to date: lots of things I tried seemed to no longer be true. It also contains gems like this:

  > The Nirin Cloud integrated object storage service supports a subset of the Swift and S3 access control mechanisms, with additional constraints which make them very limited for practical use. The NCI Cloud Team does not recommend the use of anything beyond the simplest case of enabling public read access to a container, which can be done via a simple check box for each container in the dashboard's Object Store → Containers tab.

  Which subset does the Nirin object stoage support? Not documented. And even though it explicitly states that you can set public read access, this only seems to apply to using the Swift Access protocol. In fact, it seems that the bucket policies are not set on the bucket itself, but on the access protocol. So you can have a totally different set of policies depending on whether you try to access it via Swift, or via s3api.

  If someone at NCI knows how to fix this, please let me know!

Recommendations for Nirin

- Use kerchunk + Swift only if the Swift gateway performs well from the interactive environment you plan to use; otherwise use S3 reads with signed URLs or a proxy.
- If anonymous S3 reads are required, request that from NCI support or plan for a proxy service in Nirin that holds credentials and serves kerchunk JSON.
- For icechunk, plan to use the S3 gateway with credentials and `force_path_style=True`; handle secrets securely (don’t bake them into notebooks 🫠).
- Benchmark both Swift and S3 reads from your intended client (ARE, Gadi interactive node, etc.) — performance varies a lot depending on where you run the client.
- Consider placing the interactive catalog/parquet files in Nirin object storage (if compute nodes can read them) to reduce cross-site syncing.

Bottom line: Nirin is usable, but the lack of anonymous S3 reads and the Swift/S3 performance differences make it more operationally fiddly than Acacia. The usual workarounds are: enable anonymous access, run a small trusted proxy inside Nirin, or accept credentialed access with careful secret management.

# Some final thoughts

- The fact that one man in a shed in Western Australia can do all this in this in a few days is pretty amazing, and it's a testament to the work of the people who built these tools. It's also a testament to the power of open source software and the scientific Python ecosystem. In particular, big shoutout to Tom Nicholas and Martin Durant for their work on virtualizarr and kerchunk, which made this all possible, the entire earthmover team for what they've been doing in this area (including open sourcing icechunk), and the carbonplan team for zarr-layer.
- Shout out to Dougie Squire and Thomas Moore, amongst others, for really pushing these ideas in Australia. If they hadn't been so keen on these things, I think it would have taken me a lot longer to discover the possibilities in this space.
- Building reliable infrastructure is really tough - it's no wonder that Amazon have been so successful, having more or less cracked the problem. It's amazing that Pawsey and NCI are able to replicate this functionality on a much tighter budget.
- We already have the tools and infrastructure to distribute data effectively, here in Australia. We just need to make use of them.
